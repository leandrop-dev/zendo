# Zendo

A game launcher for Linux: every game in one library, in a normal window with
a full-screen mode for the couch, launched with the right tools, and mods
later. A sister project of [hyprmonk](../hyprmonk), MIT like it.

Status: planned on 2026-11-04 from a hyprmonk session.
2026-11-05: window default, Rust + Iced and optional tools decided; first
session: the repo, the package checks and phase 1 built (see Phases).
2026-11-06: phase 1 checked against a real game from each store; phase 2
built. Then the direction changed: Zendo follows Hikari's functionality
and UI/UX [firm]; omarchy-games-menu was only ever a source of ideas for a
Rust launcher. The phases below are reordered for that. Phase 3, the
Hikari-layout shell, built the same day.

## Direction [firm]

Chosen on 2026-11-06:

- Hikari's functionality: Zendo signs in to Epic, GOG and Amazon itself and
  installs, updates and uninstalls through legendary, gogdl and nile (the
  copies Heroic bundles when they are not installed alone), with a Store
  page of owned games and a Downloads page. Steam's and Heroic's installed
  games keep being imported read-only.
- Hikari's layout, hyprmonk's colours: a sidebar (Library, Store,
  Downloads; Accounts, Settings, About), a top bar with search, store chips
  and sort chips, a game page with a wide hero image, an action bar and a
  details card, and a Settings page (keys, engines, Wine/Proton,
  diagnostics). The palette is Zendo's own until hyprmonk writes
  `tone.json`.
- The controller and F11 full-screen stay, as extras Hikari does not have.
- Order: the new shell first, with the SteamGridDB key entered in Settings;
  then accounts, Store and Downloads; then launch options; then local games
  and mods.

## What it should do

- One library of every game: Steam, Epic, GOG and Amazon, and games installed
  by hand (native or Wine). Emulators may come later.
- Launch each game the way it needs: Steam games through Steam, Windows games
  through Proton (umu-launcher) with a prefix per game, and MangoHud, GameMode
  and gamescope switched on per game.
- Covers from SteamGridDB, kept in a cache.
- Driven by keyboard and controller: type to filter, sort by what is played
  most and lately.
- Mods in a later phase: Nexus links, profiles, back to vanilla.
- A normal app window by default, full-screen as an option [firm]. Follows
  hyprmonk's tone when it finds it.

## Stack

Rust, one `zendo` binary with an [Iced](https://iced.rs) window [firm].
Chosen over:

- Quickshell: a toolkit for desktop shells, not apps. Users would need it
  installed, the UI and the command would be two processes talking over a
  JSON file, and Qt 6 has no gamepad module.
- Raw wgpu: a drawing API, not a UI toolkit; text, layout, scrolling, focus
  and input would all be ours to write.
- Qt/QML through cxx-qt: a heavier build and a Qt dependency.

Controller input through the `gilrs` crate; hyprmonk's `tone.json` becomes an
Iced theme.

Layout [tentative], built this way: `crates/zendo-core` (library scan,
launching, state, config and covers) and `crates/zendo` (the Iced app, plus
`list`, `launch`, `hide`, `unhide` and `covers` commands for keybinds and scripts).

Iced has not reached 1.0 and its API changes between releases. Pinned at
0.14.0 and gilrs at 0.11.2 (the current releases on 2026-11-05). Iced 0.14
has a `Grid` widget, but the grid is laid out as rows of fixed-size cards so
the arrow keys know the column count; the selection is Zendo's own, not
Iced's widget focus, so keyboard and controller move the same cursor.

Call the tools that already exist instead of writing them again:
`steam` (`steam://rungameid/ID`), Heroic's engines legendary (Epic), gogdl
(GOG) and nile (Amazon), umu-launcher, mangohud, gamemoderun and gamescope.
Before depending on one, check where it is packaged (Arch repos, CachyOS
repos, AUR) and its licence.

Checked 2026-11-05. All are run as separate programs, never linked, so their
GPL does not reach Zendo's MIT:

| Tool | Packaged | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| umu-launcher | multilib 1.4.4, cachyos 1.4.3 | GPL-3.0-only |
| legendary | AUR 0.21.1 | GPL-3.0-or-later |
| gogdl | AUR `heroic-gogdl` 1.1.2 | GPL-3.0-only |
| nile | no package of its own | GPL-3.0 (Heroic's) |
| gamemode | extra 1.8.2 | BSD-3-Clause |
| Heroic | `heroic-games-launcher` 2.22.4 | GPL-3.0-only |

Heroic bundles all three store engines under
`/usr/lib/heroic-games-launcher/app.asar.unpacked/build/bin/x64/linux/`, so
phase 4 can use those when nile (or the others) are not installed alone.

What phase 1 reads from Heroic, checked in Heroic 2.22.4's own code: under
`~/.config/heroic` (or Flatpak's `~/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/config/heroic`),
`legendaryConfig/legendary/installed.json`, `gog_store/installed.json` with
titles from `store_cache/gog_library.json`, `nile_config/nile/installed.json`
with titles from its `library.json`, and `sideload_apps/library.json`. Games
start with `heroic://launch?appName=<id>&runner=legendary|gog|nile|sideload`.

`.desktop` files: launchers and tools also file themselves under `Game`
alone (Faugus, Goverlay, Heroic, Lutris, Steam), so no category tells them
apart. `desktop.rs` keeps a list of the known ones, and any entry can be
hidden from the window (phase 2).

What phase 2 reads, checked on 2026-11-06 against Heroic 2.22.4 and a
current Steam client with one game from each store installed:

- Covers. Steam's `appcache/librarycache/<app>/library_600x900.jpg`.
  Heroic's `store_cache/legendary_library.json`, `gog_library.json` and
  `nile_library.json` (top key `library` or `games`) give each game's
  `art_square`, a portrait image on the store's CDN (Epic 1200x1600, GOG
  300x450, Amazon 1080x1440). Heroic's own `images-cache` names files by the
  SHA-256 of the URL, but holds only what Heroic has shown, so Zendo
  downloads into a cache of its own instead.
- SteamGridDB (`https://www.steamgriddb.com/api/v2`, `Authorization:
  Bearer <key>`), tried with a real key on 2026-11-06:
  `search/autocomplete/{name}`, `grids/game/{id}` and `grids/steam/{app}`
  with `dimensions=600x900,342x482,660x930` (a size it does not know gets a
  400, "Invalid asset dimensions specified"; Zendo then falls back to the
  first image taller than wide), and `heroes/game/{id}` and
  `heroes/steam/{app}` for the wide images (1920x620). A bad key gets a
  401, "Invalid key format"; no key a 401, "Authentication Required".
  Settings checks a key with one `search/autocomplete` call.
- Wide images (phase 3). Steam's `library_hero.jpg` beside the cover;
  Heroic's store caches give `art_cover`, a landscape image, and
  `developer`. Install details: legendary's `installed.json` has
  `install_path`, `install_size` (bytes), `platform` and `version`; Heroic's
  GOG `installed.json` the same with `install_size` as a label
  ("75.85 GiB"); nile's `path`, `size` (bytes) and `version`; Steam's
  manifest `installdir`, `SizeOnDisk` and `buildid`.
- Play records. Steam: `LastPlayed` in each `appmanifest_*.acf`, and
  `LastPlayed` and `Playtime` (minutes) under
  `UserLocalConfigStore/Software/Valve/Steam/apps/<app>` in
  `userdata/<account>/config/localconfig.vdf`. Heroic:
  `store/timestamp.json`, `lastPlayed` (ISO-8601, may be empty) and
  `totalPlayed` (minutes) by app name; its store splits keys on dots, so
  Amazon ids (`amzn1.adg.product.…`) are nested objects to join back.

Zendo's own files [tentative]: `~/.config/zendo/config.toml` for what the
user sets (`steamgriddb_key`, `download_covers`), written by the Settings
page with mode 0600 because it holds the key (comments added by hand are not
kept; Hikari uses the system keyring first, which Zendo could add later
[tentative]); `~/.local/state/zendo/state.json`
for what Zendo remembers (launches, hidden and pinned games, the sort),
written by the window and the command alike; and `~/.cache/zendo/covers/`
with `<id>.<ext>` covers, `<id>.hero.<ext>` wide images and a
`misses.json` (keys `<id>` and `<id>#hero`) so a game without one is asked
about again only after a week. One state file, not omarchy-games-menu's split by owner, since both
sides write the same few things; each write reads, changes and renames the
file into place.

Covers are kept at the size the store serves them. Iced decodes each to
full-size RGBA (the Amazon one is about 6 MB in memory), which is fine for a
few dozen games; for large libraries, scale them down when saving [re-evaluate
once someone has a few hundred games].

## What the user needs installed [tentative]

Nothing is required. Zendo detects each tool and shows what is missing.

| Tool | Needed for |
|---|---|
| Steam | Steam games. The library is read from files, but launching goes through the client. |
| Heroic | Only phase 1's import of the games it installed. Optional from phase 4. |
| legendary, gogdl, nile | Phase 4: Epic, GOG and Amazon games. |
| umu-launcher | Windows games installed by hand. Check whether it fetches Proton itself. |
| MangoHud, GameMode, gamescope | Only games where they are switched on. |

## Ideas from (ideas only, no code copied)

- [Hikari](https://github.com/dodo986/hikari) (GPL-3.0, Go daemon + React
  window in Wails/WebKitGTK), the model for Zendo's functionality and UI/UX.
  Pages (from its README, CHANGELOG and `frontend/web/src/pages`, read
  2026-11-06): Library and Store (installed vs owned, a cover grid, search,
  store chips with counts, "A-Z" and "Playing first" sort chips, pins that
  lead the library, "+ Add game", "Refresh"); a game page ("← Library" and a
  breadcrumb, a landscape hero with store/installed badges, title,
  developer and facts, an action bar "Play now / Launch command / Settings
  / Log / Pin", a status line, a "Game details" card, an OptiScaler card,
  and sheets for game settings, the launch command and the launch log);
  Downloads; Accounts (Epic, GOG and Amazon sign-in in a private browser
  window, falling back to pasting a code); Settings (the daemon, a
  Wine/Proton manager with GE-Proton and Proton-CachyOS downloads, engine
  readiness, API keys kept in the system keyring with a 0600 file as
  fallback, Diagnostics with "Copy report"); About; Mods. It drives legendary/gogdl/nile with credentials of its own; imports
  Heroic's installed games and reads Steam libraries (native, Flatpak, Snap)
  without writing to them; umu/Proton or Wine with a prefix per game;
  DXVK/VKD3D, EAC/BattlEye runtimes; MangoHud, GameMode, gamescope and custom
  wrappers; mods through Amethyst Mod Manager's backend (Nexus, FOMOD,
  `nxm://`); OptiScaler; `logs` and `report` commands and a diagnostics page.
  GPL: read for ideas, never copy.
- [omarchy-games-menu](https://github.com/akitaonrails/omarchy-games-menu)
  (MIT, Rust `ogm` + Quickshell), ideas for a Rust launcher only, not the
  model: full-screen grid of covers in sections;
  SteamGridDB covers cached under `~/.cache/ogm/covers` with themed
  placeholders when there is no API key; frecency sort; type anywhere to
  filter; controller support; games found from `.desktop` files with
  `X-OGM-*` keys and TOML catalog fragments in `catalog.d`; update checks
  against GitHub releases and web pages; state split by owner (`state.json`
  for the CLI, `prefs.json` for the UI); a preview of the UI against fixture
  data.

## Phases

1. Library, read-only: Steam libraries (`libraryfolders.vdf`,
   `appmanifest_*.acf`), Heroic's installed games, `.desktop` games. The cover
   grid and launching. Built 2026-11-05, with type-to-filter, keyboard and
   controller moves and F11 full-screen; Steam covers come from Steam's own
   `appcache/librarycache`. On 2026-11-06 `zendo list` found the four test
   games (Hexologic on Steam, Absolute Drift on Epic, Cyberpunk 2077 on GOG,
   Metal Slug X on Amazon) with the right titles. Not yet tried: starting a
   game from Zendo, a real controller, the full-screen toggle live.
2. Covers (the stores' portrait art, SteamGridDB with a key) for the games
   without one, sorting by recent, most played or title (Tab, Y), hiding
   entries (Delete, X; Ctrl+H or Start shows them). Built 2026-11-06; the
   window downloaded the three Heroic covers by itself and sorted the four
   games by last played. Checked later that day: SteamGridDB with a real key
   (`dimensions=600x900,342x482,660x930` accepted, a bad size gets a 400 with
   "Invalid asset dimensions specified"; search and grids by Steam app or
   game id work), and every key in the live window through `wtype`, F11
   full-screen included.
3. The shell, Hikari's layout: a sidebar (Library, Settings, About for now;
   Store, Downloads and Accounts join with phase 4), the Library page (title
   and counts, search box, Refresh, store chips with counts, sort chips,
   showing hidden games, pins that lead the grid, cards with a store badge),
   the game page (back and breadcrumb, a hero from Steam's
   `library_hero.jpg`, Heroic's `art_cover` or SteamGridDB's heroes, badges,
   developer, an action bar with Play, Pin and Hide, a status line, a
   details card with store, launcher, install path, size, version and play
   time), Settings (the SteamGridDB key typed in and checked, covers on or
   off, the sources found, Zendo's files) and About. A click or Enter opens
   a game; Play starts it. Built 2026-11-06 (`crates/zendo/src/app/`, one
   module per page). Checked live through `wtype` on the four test games:
   every page, pinning (the pinned game leads), the search, the Heroic wide
   images downloaded by themselves, Steam's from its cache; and on scratch
   folders, a wrong key turned down and not saved, the real one accepted
   and written with mode 0600. Save keeps a key only once SteamGridDB takes
   it, or when the site cannot be reached. Keys added: F1 About, Ctrl+,
   Settings, Ctrl+F search, Ctrl+P pin, F5 or Ctrl+R refresh; on a game's
   page Y pins and X hides. Not yet tried: Play from the game page on a
   real game, a real controller.
4. Accounts, Store and Downloads: sign in to Epic, GOG and Amazon through
   legendary, gogdl and nile; the games owned but not installed; install,
   update, repair and uninstall with a queue. To decide then: whether
   downloads need a background process of their own that outlives the
   window, as Hikari's daemon does.
5. Launch options per game (a game settings sheet): Proton through umu with
   a prefix per game, a Wine/Proton manager (GE-Proton downloads), MangoHud,
   GameMode, gamescope, arguments and environment, a log of each launch.
6. Local games: "Add game", with a cover search on SteamGridDB.
7. Mods: Nexus, `nxm://`, profiles, back to vanilla.

## On hyprmonk's side

- Install it (package list or the installer) and bind a key (Super+G).
- The tone: hyprmonk writes no file with the active tone's colours yet
  (`~/.local/state/hyprmonk/theme/colors.json` is matugen's wallpaper palette,
  `tone.lua` only the border accent). Add a `tone.json` there for Zendo to
  read into its Iced theme, with its own colours when the file is missing.
- hyprmonk's roadmap points here; this file is the plan.

## Next session

- Start each test game from its page, and check it shows up first under
  Recent afterwards.
- Try a controller on the new pages.
- Start phase 4: read how legendary, gogdl and nile sign in and list owned
  games, and decide whether downloads need a background process.

## Conventions

As in hyprmonk: commit on main, no attribution lines, commit only when asked.
